# minesweeper.go

This is written using ebiten v2 in Go:

    sudo apt install golang

To build/run the code you can execute:

    go run minesweeper.go

On Debian/Ubuntu I had to install the following packages:

    sudo apt install libc6-dev libglu1-mesa-dev libgl1-mesa-dev libxcursor-dev libxi-dev libxinerama-dev libxrandr-dev libxxf86vm-dev libasound2-dev pkg-config


On Ubuntu 18.04 I had to install the libgl1-mesa and libgtk-3 development package:

    sudo apt install libgl1-mesa-dev
    sudo apt install libgtk-3-dev

# minesweeper.go

This is written using ebiten v2 in Go:

    sudo apt install golang

To build/run the code you can execute:

    go run minesweeper.go

On Ubuntu 20.04 I had to install the libxxf86vm (Extension library for the XFree86-VidMode X extension) development package:

    sudo apt install libxxf86vm-dev
